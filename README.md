# 🌍 GDP Analysis of Different Countries

This project performs an in-depth data analysis on the GDP of different countries using Python. It involves preprocessing, data visualization, extracting insights, and using clustering to group countries based on GDP growth and characteristics.

---

## 📈 Objective

To analyze the GDP data of various countries, identify trends and patterns, and use unsupervised learning (clustering) to segment countries into categories such as:
- Highest Growing Economies
- Moderate Growth
- Slow Growth
- Declining Economies

## 🧠 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Descriptive analysis of GDP per country
- GDP trend visualization (bar plots, pie charts, and line graphs)
- Country-wise GDP comparison
- K-Means Clustering for segmentation based on GDP metrics
- Extraction of actionable insights and observations

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (K-Means Clustering)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Pie Charts** to show GDP share of top economies
- **Bar Charts** to compare GDP over years or regions
- **Line Plots** to show growth trends
- **Scatter Plots** (for clustering visualization)
- **Heatmaps** for correlation analysis

---

## 🔍 Clustering Analysis

Used **K-Means Clustering** to group countries into 4 clusters:
1. 🔴 High Growth Economies
2. 🟠 Moderate Growth
3. 🟡 Low Growth
4. 🔵 Declining or Stagnant Economies

---

## 📌 Insights Extracted

- Identified top contributors to global GDP
- Detected regions with highest and lowest GDP growth
- Found patterns in GDP trends over time
- Segmented countries for economic strategy suggestions
